  "abstract": "Merkle hash trees are the standard method to protect the integrity and freshness of stored data. However, hash trees introduce additional compute and I/O costs on the I/O critical path, and prior efforts have not fully characterized these costs. In this paper, we quantify performance overheads of storage-level hash trees in realistic settings. We then design an optimized tree structure called _Dynamic Merkle Trees (DMTs)_ based on an analysis of root causes of overheads. DMTs exploit patterns in workloads to deliver up to a 2.2× throughput and latency improvement over the state of the art. Our novel approach provides a promising new direction to achieve integrity guarantees in storage efficiently and at scale."
