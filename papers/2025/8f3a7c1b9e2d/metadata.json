  "abstract": "Emerging storage technologies, such as persistent memory and ultra-low latency SSD, enable the deduplication file system (DedupFS) to use non-cryptographic hash for fast fingerprinting. However, we find that the accelerated computation exposes another major performance penalty: the seemingly innocuous in-storage deduplication metadata maintenance incurs up to 38% overhead in the I/O path.\nWe find the root cause is that DedupFSes maintain dedup-specific _fingerprint-to-physical_ mappings, which incurs additional crash consistency overheads. However, this overhead is unnecessary. Our insight is that the deduplication mapping can be merged with the file system _logical-to-physical_ mapping, forming a _logical-fingerprint-physical_ (LFP) mapping. Thus, we can persist deduplication metadata alongside file system metadata in a single I/O. We propose GogetaFS to realize the efficiency of LFP. Using a series of techniques to manage data and metadata atop LFP, GogetaFS achieves compatible, effective, and memory-efficient deduplication within the file system. Experiments across a range of workloads show that GogetaFS consistently outperforms existing DedupFSes and can minimize metadata maintenance overheads."
