  "abstract": "Memory disaggregation has become a major trend in cloud-native databases. However, most existing memory disaggregation solutions suffer from read/write amplification, limited bandwidth, inefficient recovery, and challenges in data sharing. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities for memory disaggregation design in cloud-native databases.\nTo overcome these challenges, we leverage the CXL switch to design _PolarCXLMem_, a CXL-switch-based disaggregated memory system for cloud-native databases. To the best of our knowledge, _PolarCXLMem_ is the first CXL-switch-based disaggregated memory system. Building on _PolarCXLMem_, we propose a novel instant recovery scheme, _PolarRecv_, which enables instant recovery and fast buffer pool warm-up after a crash. To further support _PolarCXLMem_ in multi-primary databases, we design a new cache coherency protocol that facilitates data sharing between database nodes based on _PolarCXLMem_. Finally, we evaluate _PolarCXLMem_ with PolarDB, a widely deployed cloud-native database, under various workloads. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that investigates the performance of CXL-based disaggregated memory in a commercially deployed cloud-native database. Our evaluation shows that _PolarCXLMem_ can improve throughput by up to 2.1x in pooling scenarios and 1.55x in sharing scenarios compared to RDMA-based systems."
