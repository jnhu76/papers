  "abstract": "Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown that the _internal_ networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model-- requiring _prior physical access_ --has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to _remote_ compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the _external_ attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them."
