    "abstract": "Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. It underpins long-horizon reasoning, continual adaptation, and effective interaction with complex environments. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, assumptions, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity and dynamics of contemporary agent memory systems. This survey aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we move beyond coarse temporal categorizations and propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time as agents interact with their environments. To support empirical research and practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of representative benchmarks and open source memory frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including automation-oriented memory design, the deep integration of reinforcement learning with memory systems, multimodal memory, shared memory for multi-agent systems, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."
