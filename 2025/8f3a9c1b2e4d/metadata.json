  "abstract": "With the \"non-hierarchical\" trend in emerging storage media, the philosophy of hierarchy inevitably falls short in fully leveraging the combined bandwidth of multiple devices. In this paper, we propose a horizontally structured storage architecture that leverages the combined capabilities of heterogeneous devices. We introduce PolyStore, a meta layer atop storage medium-optimized file systems that spans userspace and the OS, allowing applications to access multiple storage devices concurrently with transparent, fine-grained data placement. PolyStore maximizes cumulative storage bandwidth and reduces hardware and software bottlenecks without compromising important properties such as sharing and security. Our evaluations show that PolyStore achieves 1.11x - 9.38x performance gains for micro-benchmarks and 1.52x - 2.02x for real-world applications across various device configurations."
